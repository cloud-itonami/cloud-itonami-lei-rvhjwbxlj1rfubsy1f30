This repository archives the publicly published terms-of-service of
**The Boeing Company**, with source-url and retrieval-date provenance, per
[ADR-2607110300](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607110300-cloud-itonami-lei-corporate-tos-catalog.md)
(`cloud-itonami-lei-corporate-tos-catalog`, `com-junkawasaki/root`). It is a read-only
reference/archive repository — it does not act, propose, or execute anything on the
company's behalf, and is not a governed Advisor/Governor actor.

## Design rationale

See ADR-2607110300 in `com-junkawasaki/root` (`90-docs/adr/`) for why this repo exists,
why it is keyed by LEI rather than GTIN or ticker, and why full-text archival (with
provenance) was chosen over excerpt-only storage.
